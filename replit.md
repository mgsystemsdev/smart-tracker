# Smart Tracker

## Overview

Smart Tracker is a minimal personal learning tracker featuring a simplified workflow: just log your work and see your progress automatically. Built with a dual-interface architecture, it provides both a modern Streamlit web interface and a Typer CLI. The tracker eliminates manual progress tracking - progress is automatically calculated from hours logged. Features MG System Dev branding with golden yellow accents and a dark tech theme.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## Recent Changes (October 5, 2025)

### Studying vs Practice Tracking (20/80 Rule)
- **Simplified Session Types**: Session type dropdown now only offers "Studying" or "Practice" to focus on learning vs doing
- **Breakdown Calculation**: New helper function calculates studying/practice hours breakdown per technology
- **Visual Indicators**: Shows ðŸ“š for studying hours and ðŸ’ª for practice hours with percentages
- **Dashboard Display**: Each technology card expands to show session type breakdown (Total, Studying %, Practice %)
- **Tech Stack Integration**: Technology cards display studying/practice metrics with visual indicators
- **Planning Roadmap**: Tables include studying/practice breakdown columns for each technology
- **20/80 Monitoring**: Enables tracking if technologies maintain the recommended 20% studying, 80% practice ratio

### Category-Based Organization System (October 4, 2025)
- **Unified Category System**: Technologies now organized by planning subsection categories (Front-End, Back-End, Core Libraries, Visualization, Machine Learning, Pipelines, Databases, Deployment, Excel, Automation, Security, Supporting Skills, Uncategorized)
- **TECH_CATEGORIES Constant**: 13 predefined categories derived from planning blueprint structure
- **Category-Based Tech Stack**: Displays technologies grouped by category with collapsible sections showing category subtotals (hours logged/goal hours/completion %)
- **Category Selection**: When adding new technologies, users select which category it belongs to via dropdown
- **Category Management**: Each tech card has settings expander allowing users to reassign technologies to different categories
- **Auto-Migration**: Data model automatically migrates old "domain" field to "category" field on load
- **Data Model**: Tech stack JSON now uses "category" field (domain field removed from new technologies)

### Dynamic Planning Page
- **Live Progress Tracking**: Planning page dynamically shows only categories where user has technologies
- **Actual Hours Display**: Shows logged hours vs goal hours for each technology (e.g., "10.5 / 80 h")
- **Real-Time Progress**: Displays completion percentage calculated from actual session hours
- **Category Totals**: Automatic calculation of totals for each category showing logged/goal/progress
- **Grand Total Summary**: Complete overview showing total logged hours, total goal hours, and overall completion percentage
- **Smart Empty State**: Prompts users to add technologies if stack is empty

### Data Integrity & Logging Implementation
- **Input Validation**: Hours must be 0-12, no future dates, technology cannot be empty
- **Activity Logging**: All CRUD operations logged to /logs/activity.log with timestamps
- **Dynamic Technology Entry**: Text input with suggestions replaces fixed dropdown
- **Auto-Add to Tech Stack**: New technologies automatically added to stack when sessions are saved
- **Validation Feedback**: User-friendly error messages displayed on validation failure
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of add, edit, delete operations plus validation failures

### Technology Object Model with Goal-Based Progress
- **Tech Stack Objects**: Each technology is now a full object with name, category, goal_hours, and date_added
- **Expanded Categories**: Seven category types - Language, Framework, Library, Tool, Database, Platform, Concept
- **Goal Hours**: Set target hours when adding technologies to track progress toward mastery
- **Auto-Progress Calculation**: Progress = (logged hours / goal hours) Ã— 100 - fully automatic based on session hours
- **Persistent Storage**: Tech stack saves to tech_stack.json with all properties

### Dashboard Features
- **Progress Bars**: Each technology card shows visual progress bar with "40/100 hrs (40%)" format
- **Expandable Cards**: Cards show total hours, session count, last date - expand for full session details
- **Full Session Details**: All session information displayed (date, topic, notes, tags, type, difficulty, status, hours)
- **Inline Actions**: Edit and Delete buttons within expanded cards
- **Auto-Update**: Cards refresh automatically when sessions are added, edited, or deleted

### UI Improvements
- **Dashboard Renamed**: "Clean Dashboard" simplified to just "Dashboard"
- **Demo Section Removed**: Cleaned up home page by removing system demo buttons
- **Flexible Technology Input**: Type custom technologies or use suggestions from tech stack

## System Architecture

### Package Structure
The application follows a layered architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns:

- **Domain Layer** (`smarttracker/domain/`): Reserved for core business logic, models, and domain services
- **Application Layer** (`smarttracker/app/`): Contains user interface implementations
- **CLI Interface** (`smarttracker/cli.py`): Command-line interface using Typer framework
- **Entry Point** (`main.py`): Unified entry point that routes to appropriate interface

### Interface Architecture
**Dual Interface Design**: The application supports two distinct user interaction modes:
- **Web Interface**: Streamlit-based web application for visual interaction
- **CLI Interface**: Typer-based command-line tools for programmatic access

**Unified Entry Point**: Single `main.py` file that intelligently routes to either the Streamlit web app or CLI based on command-line arguments.

### Frontend Architecture
**Streamlit Web Application**: 
- Configured for wide layout with expandable sidebar
- Port 5000 binding with external accessibility (0.0.0.0)
- Multi-column responsive layout design
- Version information display in sidebar

**CLI Framework**:
- Typer-based with built-in help system and version callbacks
- Structured for easy command extension
- Tab completion support disabled for simplicity

### Design Patterns
**Modular Package Design**: Clean separation allows for independent development of domain logic and user interfaces. The scaffold structure supports rapid extension without architectural refactoring.

**Framework Abstraction**: Business logic remains independent of UI frameworks, enabling future interface additions without core changes.

## External Dependencies

### Core Frameworks
- **Streamlit**: Web application framework for the visual interface
- **Typer**: Modern CLI framework for command-line interface

### Runtime Environment
- **Python 3.11+**: Minimum required Python version
- **pip**: Package management for dependency installation

### Development Tools
- **pytest**: Testing framework (structure prepared in `tests/` directory)

### Data Persistence & Management
- **JSON Storage**: Learning sessions and tech stack configuration persist across sessions
- **File-based Storage**: Data saved to `data/` directory (excluded from git)
- **Automatic Backup**: Backup functionality available through storage module
- **Session Recovery**: All data automatically loaded on app startup

### CRUD Operations
- **Create**: Add new learning sessions via Smart Learning Tracker
- **Read**: View sessions with filtering and sorting in Clean Dashboard
- **Update**: Edit individual sessions with full-featured edit dialog
