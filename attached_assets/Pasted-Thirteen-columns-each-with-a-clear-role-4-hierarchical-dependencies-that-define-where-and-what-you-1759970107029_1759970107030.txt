Thirteen columns, each with a clear role:
4 hierarchical dependencies that define where and what you worked on.
8 contextual/analytic fields that define how, when, and why you did it.
1 structural field (Session ID) ensuring database integrity.
Everything else—transient, redundant, or UI-specific—was intentionally pruned so the schema stays sustainable, expressive, and fast.
#
Column
Description
Dependency
Purpose / Value
1
Session Date
The exact date of the learning or work session.
(Independent)
Anchors all activity chronologically — drives streaks, time-based KPIs, and planning analytics.
2
Session Type
Nature of the session: Practice, Study, Research, Planning, etc.
(Independent)
Defines session intent — feeds effort-type segmentation and planning metrics.
3
Category Name
Conceptual domain (e.g., Main Language, Database, Backend, Frontend).
Root Dependency
Entry point of your personal hierarchy — organizes learning areas and drives Category-first dependency flow.
4
Technology
Specific technology, framework, or language (e.g., Python, React, PostgreSQL).
Depends on → Category Name
Narrows work scope within a category — central to analytics and time allocation metrics.
5
Work Item
The specific component, module, or unit of work (e.g., Variables, Joins, Components).
Depends on → Technology
Defines tangible tasks; filters Skill/Topic options; key for operational KPIs.
6
Skill / Topic
The precise sub-skill or micro-concept (e.g., List Comprehension, Query Optimization).
Depends on → Work Item
Most granular learning unit — enables micro-KPI tracking and mastery depth analysis.
7
Category Source
Where the work or learning originated (e.g., Coursera, Docs, YouTube, Project Repo).
(Independent context field)
Tracks effectiveness of content sources and learning ROI.
8
Difficulty
Subjective difficulty rating (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced).
(Independent context field)
Used for effort weighting and learning velocity analysis.
9
Status
Current progress state (Planned, In Progress, Completed, Blocked).
(Independent context field)
Drives dashboards, workflow metrics, and completion KPIs.
10
Hours Spent
Time invested in this session (e.g., 1.25 hours).
(Independent context field)
Quantitative metric powering the Page Calculator, Planning, and Time Efficiency analysis.
11
Tags
Flexible labels (e.g., #backend, #refactor, #review).
(Independent context field)
Enables dynamic grouping, trend exploration, and AI-driven categorization.
12
Notes
Open text for qualitative context — reflections, blockers, ideas.
(Independent context field)
Adds narrative context for retrospectives, learning logs, and qualitative analytics.
13
Session ID
Unique identifier (UUID or auto-increment).
(Independent)
Ensures clean relational integrity for joins and future normalization.
